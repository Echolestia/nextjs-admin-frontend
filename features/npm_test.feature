# Feature: Admin Dashboard - Chat
#     As a medical practitioner/professional/counsellor
#     I want to be able to send and receieve messages and view users' profiles through the admin platform


#     #10 - Sad path
#     Scenario: Sending a message with 'Type your message here' field empty
#         Given the admin is in a chat again
#         When the admin has not input anything into 'Type your message here' field
#         Then the admin should not be able to send a new message when clicked on 'send'
